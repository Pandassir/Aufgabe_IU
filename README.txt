First the code downloads rawdata (train, ideal, test) from database.
Subsequently the code will find ideal functions from train data. 
The code must use test data for validate the selection. For each x-y pair in
test data, the code must test if it fits to the 4 ideal functions.
Created Dataframes wich includes found test data for each ideal function
will upload to data base. Furthermore the code shows all important 
dataframes and graphs.

Just load the the py files in your IDE and start my_code.

Also you can open my_classes if you want see the classes.

Also you can test the code with unittest with my_classes_test.
